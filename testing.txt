=== Testing of Adopt-a-Dog website ===

This document lists the various ways I tested my Adopt-a-Dog website to ensure the site will work on numerous devices. 


== Design approach and test methods ==

This website was designed with a Graceful Degradation method using Visual Studio Code. I applied various media queries to make the website responsive on different screens. During the development, I test different screen sizes using the built-in emulators for both Chrome and Firefox. I also validated my code using an HTML validator and a CSS validator.
