My experience with this project: 

I had fun making this website! It was a really good learning experience to take someone else's design and actualize it by coding from scratch. There were many learning moments and some quite challenging ones, but in the end, they reinforced important lessons. It did require quite extensive google searches to find the solutions needed, but in the end, I finally got the results I wanted with this project.

If I were to do it over again, I would probably change the sequence of the classes to reflect the correct learning order. For example, this assignment should have been the first lesson as it shows how to use the inspector and how to set up our persona before designing the site. It would have been a great experience to relate to a persona through the whole process. There were a few other features that could have benefited from more hands-on practice, but overall this website was a great design to learn the various techniques.

One great perk is getting to look at dogs during the full course!
